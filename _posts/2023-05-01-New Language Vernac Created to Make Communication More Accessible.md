New Language "Vernac" Created to Make Communication More Accessible

Posted on May 1, 2023 by Zhutao

In a move aimed at simplifying language and improving global communication, a group of linguists and language enthusiasts has created a new language called Vernac.

Designed to be a simplified version of English, Vernac focuses on everyday communication and includes a streamlined grammar and a limited vocabulary. The creators of Vernac hope that the language will be more accessible to people around the world, particularly those who struggle with English.

"We wanted to create a language that was easy to learn and use," said one of the creators, who preferred to remain anonymous. "We believe that language is a powerful tool for connecting people, and we wanted to make that connection more accessible."

Vernac incorporates elements from other languages, making it more familiar and accessible to speakers of different backgrounds and cultures. The language has gained popularity among language learners and business professionals, who find its simplicity and practical focus to be a valuable asset in their work.

"We've seen a lot of interest in Vernac, particularly from people who have struggled to learn English," said another creator. "We hope that Vernac will help to bridge the gap between languages and promote a more inclusive and connected world."

The creators of Vernac have made the language available for free online, and they encourage people around the world to learn and use it in their daily lives.

"We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to use language to its fullest potential," said the anonymous creator. "And we hope that Vernac will be a valuable asset for anyone who wants to communicate more effectively and connect with others."
