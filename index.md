## Englanto ðŸ‘‹


Englanto - This name combines the words "English" and "Esperanto," a constructed language designed to be easy to learn and serve as a universal language.

As far as I know, "Englanto" is not an established word in the English language, and therefore does not have an official meaning. However, the name "Englanto" seems to suggest a language that is based on English but shares some of the features of Esperanto, a constructed language designed to be easy to learn and serve as a universal language.
