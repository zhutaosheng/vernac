A young woman from China has found success in learning a new language called Vernac, which was created to be a simplified version of English, while living in the USA.

Ling Zhang, a 22-year-old student, had struggled with learning English in the past, finding it difficult to understand the complex grammar and vocabulary. But after hearing about Vernac from a friend, she decided to give it a try.

"At first, I was skeptical," Ling said. "But I was determined to improve my English skills, so I started to study Vernac online."

Since learning Vernac, Ling has found that she is able to communicate more effectively with people from different backgrounds and cultures, including her classmates and teachers. She has even started to use Vernac in her job as a part-time waitress, finding that it helps her to connect with customers who are non-native English speakers.

"I've seen firsthand how language can be a barrier to communication and understanding," Ling said. "But with Vernac, I feel like I have a tool that can help me break down those barriers and connect with people on a deeper level."

The creators of Vernac have been thrilled to hear about Ling's success in learning the language, and they encourage others to give it a try.
