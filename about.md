## About 

*Questions, suggestions? Weâ€™re all ears.*

Once upon a time, I struggled to learn English. I found the language to be complex and difficult to understand, with many exceptions and irregularities that made it hard to master. But I was determined to find a solution, to make English easier to learn and more accessible to people around the world.

So, I set out on a mission to create a new language, one that was based on English but with simplified grammar and vocabulary. I worked tirelessly, researching linguistics, studying other languages, and experimenting with different approaches to language design. I wanted to create a language that was easy to learn, intuitive to use, and universally accessible.

After months of hard work and dedication, I succeeded in creating a new language that I called Vernac. Vernac was designed to be a simplified version of English, with a streamlined grammar, a limited vocabulary, and a focus on everyday communication. Vernac incorporated elements from other languages, making it more familiar and accessible to speakers of different backgrounds and cultures.

With Vernac, I hoped to bridge the gap between languages and promote a more inclusive and connected world. I believed that language was a powerful tool for communication, understanding, and empathy, and that everyone should have the opportunity to use it to its fullest potential.

As Vernac gained popularity, more and more people around the world began to use it for everyday communication, business transactions, and even artistic expression. The simplicity and accessibility of Vernac made it an ideal language for learners of all ages and backgrounds, and its focus on practical communication made it a valuable asset in many different fields.

My creation of Vernac had a profound impact on the world, as it made it easier for people to communicate with each other and understand each other's perspectives. Vernac was more than just a language, it was a tool for building bridges between cultures and promoting mutual respect and understanding.

For me, creating Vernac was not just about simplifying English, but also about empowering people and helping them connect with one another. And I hoped that by creating this language, I could make a difference in the world, one conversation at a time.
