## Numbers

Vernac language has a number system similar to English, with some slight variations in pronunciation. The numbers are written as follows:

0: ziero
1: wan
2: tu
3: thri
4: four
5: faiiv
6: siks
7: saiven
8: ait
9: naiin
10: ten
The numbers 11-19 are formed by adding the suffix "-tin" to the corresponding digit (i.e., "wantin" for 11, "tutin" for 12, and so on).

The numbers 20-90 are formed by combining the corresponding tens digit with the word for "ty" (i.e., "tuti" for 20, "thriti" for 30, and so on). The is 40, which is "fourti" in Vernac.

Here are the English numbers for comparison:

0: zero
1: one
2: two
3: three
4: four
5: five
6: six
7: seven
8: eight
9: nine
10: ten
11-19: eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen
20-90: twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety
