## Vernac "Use two vowels aii to pronounce the /aɪ/ sound" a in a word 
Example: taiim,time,tɑɪm; laiik,like,lɑɪk; laiif,life,lɑɪf; goiing,going,goʊɪn

The rule used to convert "nice" to "naiis" in Vernac Phonetics is a simple phonetic rule that corresponds to the pronunciation of the word in English.

In English, the word "nice" is pronounced as /naɪs/, which consists of two sounds: the "n" sound /n/ and the "ice" sound /aɪs/. The "ice" sound is a diphthong, which means it is made up of two vowel sounds blended together: /aɪ/.

In Vernac Phonetics, the "ice" sound is represented by the combination of the letters "ai", and the "s" sound is added at the end of the word. Therefore, "nice" is pronounced as "naiis" in Vernac Phonetics, where the IPA transcription would be /naɪs/.

So, the rule is to use the "ai" combination to represent the "ice" sound, and add the final "s" sound to the end of the word to match the Vernac Phonetics pronunciation pattern.

## Vernac " words ending in consonants may not have an extra vowel sound added " a in a word 
Waii ,why,ɑɪ; compeni, company,kʌmpəni; hom,home,hjum

In Vernac Phonetics, words ending in consonants may or may not have an extra vowel sound added depending on the situation. In general, the ending consonant sound is pronounced, but if an extra vowel sound is needed for clarity or ease of pronunciation, it can be added. For example, the word "Waii" is pronounced with an extra "i" sound to distinguish it from "why" and "ɑɪ", which have different meanings. Similarly, "compeni" is pronounced with an extra "e" sound to make it easier to say compared to "company". However, some words like "hom" do not require an extra vowel sound, and are pronounced with just the ending consonant sound. The decision to add an extra vowel sound is based on the context and the speaker's preference.



## Vernac "words ending in consonants" a in a word (Not applicable)
Waiy,why,ɑɪ; compny,company,kʌmpəni; hom,home,hjum (Not applicable)

In general, when a word ends in a consonant, the ending consonant sound is pronounced, unless it is absolutely necessary to add an extra sound for clarity or ease of pronunciation.

This rule applies to most consonant endings in Vernac Phonetics, but there may be exceptions where an extra sound may be added for clarity or ease of pronunciation.

## Vernac "vowel combinations, Dipthongs " a in a word 
Aolwais,always,ɑlweiz; laot,lot,lɑt; abaut,about,baʊt

In Vernac Phonetics, there are several vowel combinations that are pronounced similar in English. These include "au," "eu," "iu," "ou," "ao," and "ai."
The combination "au" is pronounced as a diphthong, similar to the "ow" sound in "cow." 
The combination "eu" is also pronounced as a diphthong, but with a more closed mouth shape. 
The combination "iu" is pronounced as a triphthong, with the mouth moving from "ee" to "y" to "oo" in quick succession. 
The combination "ou" is pronounced as a diphthong, but with a more open mouth shape. It sounds similar to the "ow" sound in "show." 
The combination "ao" is pronounced as a single sound, similar to the "ow" sound in "bow."
The combination "ai" is pronounced as a diphthong, similar to the "ai" sound in "airplane." 

By understanding how these vowel combinations are pronounced in Vernac Phonetics, learners can better communicate and understand spoken words in the language.

ao ae ai au
Oa oo oe oi ou
Ea eo ee ei eu
Ia io ie ii iu
Ua uo ue ui uu


## Vernac "unnecessary letters" a in a word 
Bing,being,biɪŋ; naiit,night,nɑɪt
In Vernac Phonetics, unnecessary letters at the word are often removed, especially if they are silent letters. This is because the language is focused on simplifying pronunciation as much as possible. For example, the word "trapped" is spelled as "trapd" in Vernac Phonetics, with the silent "e" at the end removed. Similarly, "stopped" would be spelled "stopd," "closed" would be spelled "closd," and so on. This rule applies to most words with silent letters at the end. However, if the final letter contributes to the pronunciation of the word, it is not removed. For example, "hoping" would be spelled as "hopiin," because the "e" at the end affects the sound of the word.

## Vernac "ing/ang/eng/ung/ong" in a word 
In Vernac Phonetics, when the letters "ing/ang/eng/ung/ong" appear in a word, they are pronounced as "ing", "ang", "eng", "ung", and "ong" respectively. This is because the English pronunciation of these letters does not always match their spelling, and Vernac Phonetics aims to simplify and standardize the pronunciation of words. By using these consistent sounds for these letter combinations, it is easier for learners to read and pronounce unfamiliar words.

If there is a dound like g, then spell it like this  aun, oun, iun, eun
account,ekaunt,əkaʊnt

## Vernac "shion" in a word 
In Vernac Phonetics, the "shion" combination represents a distinct sound that is similar from the "sh" sound in English. It is pronounced as "shh-oh-nah-ree-uh" for "shionnaria." Similarly, the combination "co" followed by a consonant is pronounced as a separate sound, different from the sound of the individual letters. 

## Vernac "com" in a word 
In Vernac Phonetics, the letter "o" followed by the consonant "m" is pronounced as a nasal "o" sound, similar to the sound in the word "song". This is why "community" is pronounced as "com-miounity" 

In the case of "component", the letter "o" is followed by the consonant "n" and not "m", so it is pronounced without the nasal "o" sound.

Another example "from" is pronounced as "from". 

## Vernac "ks" in a word 
In Vernac Phonetics, the sound combination "ks" is replaced by "x" when it appears at the end of a word and the word is plural or triple. For example, "makes" is pronounced as "maiks" because the base word "make" is pronounced as "maik" and the addition of the plural "s" results in triple "s". However, if the word is "max", it is pronounced as "max" and not "maix". Similarly, nouns that end with "ks" are pronounced with an "x" sound, such as "likes" is pronounced as "laiiks" and not "laiks" because the base word "like" is pronounced as "laiik" and the addition of triple "s" does not change the pronunciation of the base word. Another example is "textbooks" which is pronounced as "taixtbuks" following the same rule.

## Vernac "iou" in a word 
In Vernac Phonetics, the letters "iou" are pronounced as "you". This applies to words like "you" and "youth". However, in some cases where "iou" appears in the middle of a word, it can be pronounced as "yu" or "io". For example, "few" would be pronounced as "fiou" because "few" has the letters "iou" in it and they are pronounced as "you".

## Vernac "l" in a word 
Pipol,people,pipl̩; ounly,only,oʊnli
In Vernac Phonetics, the letter "l" must always have a vowel sound before it. If there is no vowel before "l" in a word, then it will be pronounced as a separate consonant. For example, in the word "old," since there is no vowel before the "l," it will be pronounced as "ol-d" instead of "old". Another example is the word "cold," which would be pronounced as "col-d" instead of "cold" in Vernac Phonetics. This rule ensures clarity in pronunciation and distinguishes "l" as a separate consonant when necessary.

## Vernac "w,v,c,k" in a word 
In Vernac Phonetics, the letter "b" is pronounced as it is, without adding a vowel sound after it. Therefore, the word "problems" is pronounced as "prob-lems" instead of "pro-bu-lems". This rule is applied consistently to all words containing the letter "b" in Vernac Phonetics.
