## Discord Updating


## Learn Vernac Discord community is now live and ready for learners to join

We are thrilled to announce that our Learn Vernac Discord community is now live and ready for learners to join! This new platform will provide a fun and supportive environment for learners to connect with one another, practice their language skills, and engage in conversation.

Discord is a popular communication platform that allows users to create online communities, chat rooms, and voice channels. It's an ideal platform for language learners to connect with one another, ask questions, and practice their language skills in real-time.

Our Discord community features different channels for various topics related to Vernac language learning. Users can join voice channels to practice their speaking skills with other learners or participate in group discussions to enhance their listening and comprehension skills.

In addition to practicing their language skills, our Discord community provides learners with an opportunity to connect with other Vernac language learners from all over the world. The community is a space for learners to make new friends, share their language-learning experiences, and receive support and encouragement from one another.

To join our Learn Vernac Discord community, simply follow the link on our website and sign up for an account. We look forward to welcoming learners to our community and providing a space for them to connect and grow together.
